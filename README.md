`finCLI` is a side-project where I'm exploring how to build a CLI with Go for
automating daily tasks in my efforts in personal finances.

The current focus is on conversion and enrichment on bank statements in CSV
format, but the long-term ambition is to build a full TUI-based budgeting app
for the terminal.
